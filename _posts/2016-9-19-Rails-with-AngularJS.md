title: Single Page App with AngularJSRails and Rails...
---

For my final project on the Learn Verified program, I had to create a Single page application using AngularJS with a Rails JSON back-end.

It was challeging at first to get started on this project, because though I had gone through the lessons on AngularJS in isolation, I did not not know how to integrate it with Ruby on rails.
Questions like do I start a new rails project first and add AngulaJS or vice versa. And to top it, AngularJS just seemed very different from Ruby.

So after several google search's and reaching out to our learn instructor with a excellent blog on how to achieve this, I was up and running.

I decided to build an app that one could use to track miscellaneous expenses. The application named Expensio would allow for creation, update and delete of expense items. There is also a nice chart which shows all the expenses grouped together by category in a pie chart.

Must admit that once I started building this app, it was a lot of fun getting to know AngularJS. It was also magical like Rails and allowed for quick creation of the User Interface.
Also got to try out the booststrap library, some more in this project, and overall helped me to understand the front-end concepts a lot more.

After several issues and working through them(with Google) now have a working application.
Hope to use more of AngularJS in the future, and continue learning and building.
