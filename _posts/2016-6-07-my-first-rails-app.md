title: First Rails App...
---

Learning Ruby has been a satisfying journey. And  Rails 'magic' just adds to the experience and makes it more special.
Getting into coding my first rails app was challenging and satisfying. 
I decided on building a Task Manager App,  where Tasks could be created/categorized and then shared among many users. 

Getting started and creating a basic framework for the app  was not hard, escpecially with the rails generator commands.

Also the online book  https://www.railstutorial.org/book was a great resource.


Until next time..the journey continue...
