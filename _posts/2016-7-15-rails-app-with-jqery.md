title: Refactor Rails App with JQery and Ajax...
---

Continuing with the Rails App - 'Group Task Manager' , built previously, it was time to add some Ajax and JQery magic to it. 

Turns out Javascript is whole other beast, so switching from Ruby mode to Javascript was a bit of a challenge.
Digging through and revisitng all previous leassons on Javascript in the Learn Curriculum provided some sanity. Now I truly understood why Ruby is so natural and loved so much.

But Javascript did have it advantages in term of the  being able to build fun and event driven UI's easily.

First up was refactoring the 'Task Details' page or show action using Ajax so the details would show up on the page when 'clicked' without redirecting to whole new details page. 



Until next time..the journey continue...
