title: Refactor Rails App with Jqery and Ajax...
---

Continuing with the Rails App that I built previously. It waas time to add Ajax and Jqery magic to it. 

Now Javascript is whole other beast, so switching from ruby mode to Javascript was a bit of a challenge.




Until next time..the journey continue...
