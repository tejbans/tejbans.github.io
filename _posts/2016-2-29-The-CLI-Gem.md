title: The CLI Gem project!
---

The learning experience with 'Learn' has been pretty awesome so far. 
Few days ago I started a lab/project that I had skipped previously 'Creating a ruby CLI gem'.

In hindside it seems good that I had moved forward a bit skiping this before,  as now I had to go through previous lessons on scraping and Avi's video lecture on this topic, to get started,  which really revised my understanding of the topic. 

Finally decided on scraping a a popular news site for the project. This was the first project where I was building something from 'scratch'.  This really made me think about patterns in programming, and also how the knowledge of different tools can change you code considerably. There is a lot more to learn! 

I will admit that Google had been a good friend in the process.

Lot of decisions and four days later I think I have something presentable. Will be submitting it today looking forward to the pairing session with a Flatiron expert.

 All in all a very satisfying experience! Thanks Learn.co
