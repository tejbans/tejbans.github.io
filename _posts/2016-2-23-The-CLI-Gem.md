title: The CLI Gem project!
---

The learning experience with 'Learn' has been pretty awesome so far. Today I am trying to get back to a lab/project that I had skipped- creating a ruby CLI gem.
Going through previous lessons on scraping and Avi's video lecture on this topic.
And deciding on a domain for this project ...
