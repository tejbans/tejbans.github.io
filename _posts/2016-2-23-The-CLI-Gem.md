title: The CLI Gem project!
---

The learning experience with 'Learn' has been pretty awesome so far. Today I am trying to get back to a lab/project that I had skipped- creating a ruby CLI gem.
Going through previous lessons on scraping and Avi's video lecture on this topic.
And deciding on a domain for this project ...

Yesterday finalised the domain for the project. Started work on it. Found out some web pages make scarping them not very easy! Though google helped me with a alternate page just in time. Still trying to format the content to how I would it...which actually makes me want to change the underlying data structure that I created...
