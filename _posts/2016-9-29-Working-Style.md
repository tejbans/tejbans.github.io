title: Working Style with Web Fundamentals...
---

Hello folks, its been a great journey so far learning the ins and outs of web development.
I have come to realize that this journey is infinite, guess like any other thing.
Especially in the world of IT there are always new technologies being created to do better things or existing ones being refined and updated.
Also found out that, that the more I actually write the code( instead of copying and pasting) the more I learn.
At this point I havent worked too much on test driven development, which I am sure is one of the better ways to develop, will be doing that more soon. For now below is my current style

So when begining a new project or assigment:

- I like to get a sense of the finished product first on how the User Experience would be using the app.

- Then build the model or underlying data structure, which also helps in getting a sense of the different asociations that will be needed for the app.

- Next is building the initial home page for the app and getting it to respond. On success take a break and congratulate myself.

- Then building on each feature at a time, just getting them to work ( not making them pretty yet).

- Once I have all the features working and wired up to each other, take a break.congratulate again.

- Now is the time to refine the code , make it pretty and efficient. Remind myself not to get too carried away in making pretty as this can become a big time sync without providing much more value.

 When the right balance between functionality and pretty is reached, it is very satisfying (that is, until next update!).
