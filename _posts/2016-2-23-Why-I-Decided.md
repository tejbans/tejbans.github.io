title: Why I decided to learn software development...
---

Growing up, I always had a love for machines, like many other kids in school. Be it a car or an electronic device. So going to engineering school was a natural progression. Then after school getting a job was the next step ,or the most important step depending on who you asked at the time.

Ended up working in a few big corporations mostly doing systems integration or application support. Which involved setting up IT systems for new users or supporting these existing systems. These IT systems were specialized systems used by electric utility companies. So supporting users of these system, I got to experience the frustrations that the users experienced at certain times when trying to do certains tasks or get their job done. Many of the times it was the way the software/application was designed. 

Around the same time Apple came out with the Iphone, and it was my first time experiencing Apple products. Definately made me appreciate User-Experince a lot more!. So all this, coupled with not being able to apply my creative faculties( or atleast try to) made me want to be on the other side , i.e building stuff and doing something more creative.

Fortunately I was able to take a break from my job to figure out what I wanted to do next. Then one day searching online I stumbled upon the 'Flatiron School' and tried their free software development track learning the Ruby language. Which I loved and was very satisfying personally.
 
 Then it dawned on me that this is what I must learn since it satisfies my love for tech and engages me creatively.
 
 So I registered for Flatiron's 'Full Stack Web Development program' and I am enjoying evry bit of it.
 
 Cheers to many more years of learning and creating!
