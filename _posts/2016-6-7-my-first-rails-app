title: First Rails App!

Still enjoying my journey with 'Learn'.  So I had  to create a Sinatra MVC application for one of the assements.

I decided on a application that can one can use to manage Todo Lists. Ended up with a simple MVC application that can have several users with each user creating/managing his/her todo Lists.

While creating the application I decided to have an option of priority for each task. Getting into it, also wanted the user to have a simple easy way to tell the priority when viewing a list.

This feature was the most fun implementing as it refreshed my HTML/CSS which we had learned in the begining of the course. Ended up with different colors to the bullets based on the priority level. 
Now I realise that one can spend a lot of time on things like  just getting the color right sometimes, especially when you are having fun!

Though the application is quite simple it brought togther the MVC concept very nicely for me . 

Until next time..the journey continue...
